## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I leared a little bit more about alignment of the elements by having everything as close to the actual design. Also I got more comfortable with creating responsive designs.

### Continued development

There's still a few things that I need to better understand, however by doing more challenges I feel like there's going to be a lot more improvement.
